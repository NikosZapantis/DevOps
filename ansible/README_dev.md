# How to execute:

`cd ansible
python3 generate_inventory.py
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini frontend-playbook.yml`

# Playbooks:

- **roles/frontend/tasks/main.yml**, is for frontend setup in the VM.
- **inventory.ini** is generated by the .py by parsing .env data.
- **roles/frontend/handlers/main.yml**, is for frontend restart. 

# Needed mods:

    - We need to parse from the .env file the correct VM IP and ansible user etc.
    - We need to change some things inside the playbooks to open correctly the frontend in our VM.
